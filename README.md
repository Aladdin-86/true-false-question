# true-false-question
In this code, I again modify the previous Quiz program from previous repository, and created an abstract class called "Question", modified "MultipleChoiceQuestion" to inherite from it, and added a new subclass to "Question" called "TrueFalseQuestion". 
In this repository I again involved cutting and pasting from existing classes. as I'm retroactively applying those new features.
